# Chief of Stuff - Your Living Second Brain

**"Your curious Slack buddy who never forgets and always asks the right questions"**

This isn't automation - it's a conversational AI companion that learns how you think, constantly reorganizes your work context, and helps you stay on top of complex projects without getting in your way.

## How It Works

**Markdown as Database** → Your projects, tasks, and reading list live in simple markdown files  
**Conversational Intelligence** → Chat naturally with an AI that updates your files based on every answer  
**Progressive Context** → From quick rules to detailed memories, any agent can jump in and understand everything  
**Constant Learning** → Every question you answer refines how the system organizes your mental model

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo** to your local machine
2. **Run the setup command:** Type `setup` in your first conversation
3. **Chat naturally** or use three core commands: `menu`, `sync`, `brag`
4. **Watch your second brain evolve** as the AI learns your work patterns and priorities

## Your Second Brain Structure

```
chief-of-stuff-{your-username}/
  user-context.md        # Your role, team, preferences, Slack channels
  projects.md            # Active projects with stakeholders and timelines
  tasks.md              # Standalone action items by priority
  reading-list.md       # Learning materials by urgency
  
  commands/             # Command execution instructions
  projects/             # Individual project workspaces with extended context
  message-archive/      # Message archiving system files
  brag-docs/            # Weekly accomplishment tracking
```

## Three Commands, Infinite Possibilities

- **`menu`** → Clean 7-option dashboard of your work
- **`sync`** → Pull fresh context from Slack, Calendar, GitHub, Google Workspace, Vault  
- **`brag`** → Guided interview to create promotion-ready accomplishment docs

*Each command has detailed instructions in `/commands/` - the AI reads these automatically.*

## The Magic: Curious Intelligence

This system **assumes it doesn't understand** and **constantly asks for clarification**:

- *"This looks related to your current project, but I'm not sure - is that right?"*
- *"Help me understand how this fits with your current priorities"*  
- *"Let me update your project context based on what you just told me"*

**Every answer you give immediately updates your markdown files.** Your changing brain = constantly evolving second brain.

## Progressive Disclosure System

Any AI agent jumping into a new conversation follows this path:

1. **`.cursorrules`** → Basic behavioral rules and file structure
2. **Cursor memories** → Your personal preferences and work context
3. **`README.md`** → System overview and command structure  
4. **Live data files** → Current projects, tasks, reading list
5. **Detailed instructions** → Command-specific guidance when needed

**Result:** Zero onboarding time, maximum context awareness, consistent helpful behavior.

## Setup Process

This is a **template repository**. The first time you use it:

1. **Clone this repo** to your local machine
2. **Start a Cursor conversation** and type `setup`
3. **Follow the guided setup** - it will:
   - Test your MCP connections (Slack, Google, etc.)
   - Import your profile from Vault
   - Create your personalized working files
   - Remove template files and customize everything for you
   - Set up your personal Slack inbox channel

The setup process transforms this template into your personalized productivity system.

## Philosophy

**Your work is complex and constantly changing.** Traditional productivity tools break when priorities shift or context evolves. This system **embraces the chaos** by staying curious, asking questions, and reorganizing your mental model in real-time.

**The AI doesn't assume it knows what you want.** It asks, learns, updates, and asks again. Your second brain stays synchronized with your actual brain.
