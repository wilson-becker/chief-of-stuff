# Brag Command Instructions

## When User Says `brag`
Start the guided brag doc creation process to help Wilson frame his accomplishments for career advancement.

## Brag Doc Process

### Phase 1: Gather Accomplishments
1. **Review completed work** from the past week:
   - Read projects.md â†’ Look for completed action items and accomplishments
   - Read tasks.md â†’ Look for completed tasks
   - Check recent context from sync data

2. **Present findings** to Wilson:
   ```
   ðŸŽ‰ **Found these accomplishments from the past week:**
   
   **Projects:**
   - [Project name]: [Completed action item or milestone]
   - [Project name]: [Another accomplishment]
   
   **Tasks:**
   - [Completed task with context]
   - [Another completed task]
   
   **Other Activity:**
   - [From Slack/Calendar/GitHub if relevant]
   
   Which of these feel most significant for your brag doc?
   ```

### Phase 2: Quantifying Impact Interview
For each accomplishment Wilson selects, ask these questions:

#### **Scope & Scale Questions:**
- "How many people/teams were impacted by this?"
- "What was the timeline? How complex was this work?"
- "What would have happened if you didn't do this?"

#### **Technical Skills Questions:**
- "What specific technical skills did this demonstrate?"
- "What technologies/frameworks/approaches did you use?"
- "What was challenging about this technically?"

#### **Business Impact Questions:**
- "How does this connect to business outcomes?"
- "Can we put numbers on this? (users, revenue, efficiency, time saved)"
- "What feedback did you get from stakeholders?"

#### **Leadership/Collaboration Questions:**
- "Did you influence anyone without direct authority?"
- "How did you work across teams on this?"
- "Did you mentor or teach anyone through this work?"

### Phase 3: Frame for Career Level
Help Wilson frame accomplishments at **Staff Engineer level**:

#### **Staff-Level Framing Techniques:**
- **Org-wide impact:** "This improved processes for 3 teams across Shipping & Taxes"
- **Technical leadership:** "Led architectural decisions that reduced complexity"
- **Problem identification:** "Identified systemic issue affecting multiple products"
- **Solution ownership:** "Drove end-to-end solution from problem identification to deployment"

#### **Quantification Prompts:**
- "Let's get specific numbers - how many records/users/requests/teams?"
- "What's the before/after comparison?"
- "How much time/money/effort did this save?"

### Phase 4: Create Brag Doc
1. **Use template** from `/chief/brag-doc.template.md`
2. **Fill in sections** based on interview responses
3. **Save to** `/chief/brag-docs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
4. **Update projects.md** - move accomplishments to "Accomplishments" sections

### Phase 5: Follow-up Questions
After creating the brag doc:
- "What accomplishments are you most proud of this week?"
- "What would you like to focus on next week to continue building staff-level impact?"
- "Any feedback or recognition you received that we should capture?"

## Interview Style
- **Be curious and persistent** about numbers and scope
- **Ask follow-up questions** to get deeper details
- **Help connect** technical work to business outcomes
- **Frame everything** in terms of Wilson's target career progression
- **Don't assume** - if Wilson says something is "small," dig deeper

## Success Criteria
A good brag doc session should result in:
- **Specific, quantified accomplishments** with numbers where possible
- **Clear connection** between Wilson's work and business impact
- **Staff-level framing** that shows org-wide thinking
- **Complete brag doc** saved and ready for performance reviews
- **Updated project files** with accomplishments moved to appropriate sections
