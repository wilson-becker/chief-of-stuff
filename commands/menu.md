## menu -slack (Slack Digest)

### Step 1: Use Slack MCP
Execute the slack sync logic from sync.md to get recent messages.

### Step 2: Present Conversationally
"I scanned your key Slack channels from the last day - here's what caught my attention:

**#shipping-invoice-reconciliation**: Jasmin posted about the Purolator dispute numbers - looks like the $400k gap is confirmed. Might be worth updating your project context with this.

**#team-data-channel**: Vincent shared some new BigQuery patterns that could help with your reconciliation work.

**#user-inbox**: You left yourself a note about following up with Gajanan on the finance table access.

Anything here you want me to help you act on or add to your project files?"

---

## menu -calendar (Calendar Only)

### Step 1: Use Calendar MCP
Execute calendar sync from sync.md.

### Step 2: Present Conversationally
"Looking at your calendar for the week:

**Today**: You've got that 2pm sync with the shipping team - Jasmin and Vincent will be there. Perfect timing to discuss the reconciliation progress.

**Tomorrow**: 1:1 with Vincent at 10am. Good chance to update him on your data model work and maybe get his thoughts on the finance table access issue.

**Friday**: Looks like you blocked time for deep work - smart move for tackling those BigQuery queries.

Want me to help you prep for any of these? I could pull together talking points from your project updates."

2. **Be conversational and natural** - like a knowledgeable Slack buddy
3. **Always end with a question** that invites engagement
4. **If files are empty**, say something like "Looks like your task list is empty - nice work! Anything new you want to add?"
