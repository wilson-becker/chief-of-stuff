# Brag Command - Accomplishment Interview

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Recent Work
1. Read `projects.md` → Look for completed action items
2. Read `tasks.md` → Look for completed tasks  
3. Check recent sync data if available

### Step 2: Present Findings Conversationally
"I looked through your recent work and found some solid accomplishments to brag about:

**From your projects:**
• Shipping Invoice Reconciliation - You got that data model figured out and aligned Jasmin on the approach
• [Other project] - [Natural description of what was completed]

**Tasks you knocked out:**
• [Completed task with why it mattered]

**Other wins I noticed:**
• [From recent Slack activity or meetings]

Which of these feels most significant? Or is there something else you're proud of that I missed?"

### Step 3: Interview Process
For each accomplishment Wilson selects, ask:

**Impact Questions:**
- "How many people/teams were affected?"
- "What would have happened without this work?"
- "Can we put numbers on this? (users, time saved, revenue)"

**Technical Questions:**  
- "What specific skills did this demonstrate?"
- "What was technically challenging?"
- "What technologies did you use?"

**Leadership Questions:**
- "Did you influence anyone without authority?"
- "How did you work across teams?"
- "Did you mentor anyone?"

### Step 4: Frame for Staff Level
Help Wilson frame each accomplishment with:
- **Org-wide impact**: "Improved processes for X teams"  
- **Technical leadership**: "Led architectural decisions"
- **Problem ownership**: "Drove end-to-end solution"
- **Quantified results**: Specific numbers and metrics

### Step 5: Create Brag Doc
1. Use template from `/chief/brag-doc.template.md` (if exists)
2. Save to `/chief/brag-docs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Update `projects.md` to move accomplishments to "Accomplishments" sections

### Step 6: Wrap Up Conversationally
"Nice! We got a solid brag doc together. Looking at everything you accomplished, you're definitely operating at that staff level - the cross-team impact and technical leadership really comes through.

What would you like to focus on next week to keep building on this momentum? Any particular areas where you want to expand your influence or tackle bigger technical challenges?"
